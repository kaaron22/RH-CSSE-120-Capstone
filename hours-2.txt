                                    and move with actual robot. Unable to successfully move robot
                                    or blink LED

1: 0.25 - 7:40 pm start on 11/2/16: begin feature implementation for moving robot autonomously until
                                    bump or cliff sensor indicate obstruction or cliff edge

2: 1.75 - 9:00 am start on 11/7/16: left bump sensor button functioning - instance variable in dc
                                    indicates True/False whether sensor is "active" for purposes of
                                    controlling motor on/off (to be implemented)
                                 
2: 1.5 - 9:30 am start on 11/8/16: met with part of team to work on implementation, modified connect
                                   feature to include "Connect Wired" and "Connect Wireless" buttons,
                                   attempted to implement left_bump_sensor.is_pressed()
                                
2: 0.5 - 10:15 am start on 11/9/16: tested move feature with sensor control (left_bump_sensor), tested
                                    play jingle bells and remote control feature
                                 
2: 0.5 - 2:15 pm start on 11/9/16: modified sensor move feature to call infinite move and then continually
                                   monitor sensor status (stopping when bump sensor pressed), instead of
                                   moving small distances and checking to see if sensor pressed before
                                   deciding whether or not to move again; feature needs to be tested
                                   with actual robot for proper response. also added checks to verify
                                   bump sensor "active" and bump sensor not currently pressed (either
                                   case prevents movement from beginning, with message displayed to
                                   console (eventually to be displayed on frame)). features will be
                                   scaled to additional sensors (right_bump, reflectance, etc.).
                                
3: 1.75 - 9:00 am start on 11/10/16: tested wireless feature successfully. tested change to sensor move
                                     function successfully. added status messages to frame for sensor
                                     move. added right bump sensor button (partial implementation)
                                     
3: 4.5 - 12:45 pm start on 11/10/16: added reflectance sensor monitoring

3: 0.5 - 1:30 pm start on 11/11/16: met with Professor Mutchler for code review and suggestions for
                                    improvement
                                    
3: 3.75 - 2:30 pm start on 11/11/16: modified code for efficiency in setting up labels/buttons for
                                     various sensors. added status messages for movement feature, storing
                                     some in sequence type instance variable. modified code for checking
                                     sensors during movement to be more efficient (less redundancy).

3: 3.75 - 8:15 pm start on 11/11/16: modified m0, m2 for efficiency (notes in svn for each commit),
                                     project planning
                                     
3: 2.75 - 1:30 pm start on 11/12/16: refactored connect feature, added instance variable in m0 to aid

                                    implement follow_object feature with help of professor. made
                                    some progress, but not fully functioning.
                                    
3: 1.25 - 7:15 am start on 11/14/16: added dc.textvariable sequence to m0; used in m2 for setup of
                                     stringVar() variables to assign to each ttk.Entry's textvariable
                                     option. changed foo() to switch direction upon each return from
                                     sensor_move_callback, but commented out for now until it can be
                                     tested
                                     
3: 1.25 - 10:45 am start on 11/16/16: tested code changes in foo(). commented back out because not
                                      functioning properly (not changing direction in entry). worked
                                      with m3 for calibration of move to waypoint feature.
